# EPU_foilhole_analysis

Still a work in progress so sorry it's not too user friendly... --MGI

USAGE: EPU_foilhole_analysis.py <Path to EPU metadata> <relion starfile>

THe EPU metadata must have the original directory structure as written by EPU
The starfile should be a run_itxxx_data.star from a relion reconstruction.

Later I will add features to also examine the raw picked particles vs the ones that actually went into the reconstruction. 
There may be some very interesting information hidden there.
